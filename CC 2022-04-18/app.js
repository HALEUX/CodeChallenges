//Write a function, agreeOrDisagree(), that takes in two strings, and returns 'You agree!' if the two strings are the same and 'You disagree!' if the two strings are different.

// Write your function here:
const agreeOrDisagree = (str1,str2) => str1 === str2 ?
'You agree!' : 'You disagree!'





// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep")) 
// Should print 'You agree!'
